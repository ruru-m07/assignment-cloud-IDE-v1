## bugs in the project

- we need to make available port system batter because whenever my server restarts the ports are counting again from 8000 and as you see in the video when I try to make a codespace I see that the port is already in use this is because of my next app restart

- we can make a separate server for this scenario like a Redis server it helps to manage the port running in which machine and it's also too fast.

- for this project, I use next to Handel backend and frontend both at the same time. but I say that it's a better choice that we can make a different server for the backend.
